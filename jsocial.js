        * Your function can do anything and everything, as long as it finishes in a reasonable amount of time. No infinite loops, please.
        * Once your function is written, you can call it from anywhere else in the already existing execution chain.
        * Never entirely delete anyone else's function. Edit it if needed.
        * jQuery 2.0 is included for your convenience
